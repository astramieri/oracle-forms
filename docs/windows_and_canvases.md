# Windows and Canvases

With Forms Builder, you can display an application in multiple windows by using its display objects: **windows** and **canvases**.

A **window** is a container for all visual objects that make up a Forms application. It is similar to an empty picture frame. The window manager provides the controls for the window that enable such functionality as scrolling, moving, and resizing. You can minimize a window. A single
form may include several windows.

A **canvas** is a surface inside a window container on which you place visual objects, such as interface items and graphics. It is similar to the canvas on which a picture is painted. To see a canvas and its contents at run time, you must display it in a window. A canvas always displays in the window to which it is assigned.

A **viewport** is an attribute of a canvas. It is effectively the visible portion of, or view onto, the canvas. When you resize a viewport, the window in which the canvas is displayed is resized.
