# Triggers

A trigger is a PL/SQL program unit that is executed (fired) due to an event.

Forms Builder defines a vast range of events for which you can fire a trigger:
- Query-related events
- Data entry and validation
- Logical or physical navigation
- Operator interaction with items in the form
- Internal events in the form
- Errors and messages

Events cause the activation or firing of certain trigger types.
