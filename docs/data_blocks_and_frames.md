# Data Blocks and Frames

There are 3 ways to modify properties of Forms Builder objects:
- Reentrant Wizards
- Layout Editor *(if the object appears on a canvas)*
- Property Palette
    - properties are grouped under functional headings or nodes

## Property Palette

Each form object has various types of properties. Properties are manipulated differently, depending on the property type.

Each property in a Property Palette has an icon to its left:
- **circle**: specifies that the property value is the default value
- **square**: specifies that the property values has been changed from the default
- **arrow**: specifies that the property values is inherited
- **arrow with a cross**: specifies that the property value was inherited but has been overriden 

## Visual Attributes

Visual Attribute is another object that you can create in the Object Navigator. Visual Attributes are the font, color, and pattern properties that you set for form and menu objects.
