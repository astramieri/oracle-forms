# Data Blocks and Frames

There are 3 ways to modify properties of Forms Builder objects:
- Reentrant Wizards
- Layout Editor *(if the object appears on a canvas)*
- Property Palette
    - properties are grouped under functional headings or nodes

## Property Palette

Each form object has various types of properties. Properties are manipulated differently, depending on the property type.

Each property in a Property Palette has an icon to its left:
- **circle**: specifies that the property value is the default value
- **square**: specifies that the property values has been changed from the default
- **arrow**: specifies that the property values is inherited
- **arrow with a cross**: specifies that the property value was inherited but has been overriden
