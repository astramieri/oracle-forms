# Text Items

A **Text Item** is an interface object with which you can query, insert, update, and delete data. A text item usually corresponds to a column in the database table. 

When an item is first created, its default type is text.

You can create a text item by doing one of the following:
- converting an existing item into a text item
- using the *Text Item tool* in the Layout Editor
- using the *Create icon* in the Object Navigator
- using the wizards

**Note**. To display an item at run time, **you must assign the item to a canvas** in the Property Palette.
